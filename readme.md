Hey there, 
This extension helps you save important messages from any server channel to your own personal server.


# How to add?
Just download the zip file from [releases](https://github.com/Anatame/discosave-p/releases/tag/1.0.1), extract it to a folder and then go to manage extensions > load unpacked extension > set the path to the **dist** folder inside extracted folder and done!

## How to use?

 - Click on the extension from the extensions bar,
 - Click authorize and select the server you would like the messages to be saved in.
 - Click on the server Icon which is colored.  **(Black and white color means those servers are not accesible.)**
 - Select the channel you would like to save the messages in.
 - Hover over the message you would like to save and click on the save icon.
 - Done!

## Missing features
- Doesn't save text from messages with images in them.
- Doesn't work on messages with multiple attachments.
- Doesn't work on embeds.

Most of the missing features will be added in future releases/updates.

## Source
The source code contains legacy files and needs to be refactored. This project was very experimental to me at first and I didn't focus on best practices. It will be refactored and improved once I get enough time.
